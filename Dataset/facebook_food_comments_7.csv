https://www.facebook.com/tadkatales/posts/1760955867535264,Yesss! I've been drinking my coffee this way for over a year now. I don't mind the flavour. But I love the energy boost & it keeps me full for hours. Everyone else is missing out 😂😂,Jasmine Morgan,2017-08-01T18:45:53.000Z,1
https://www.facebook.com/tadkatales/posts/1760955867535264,and you don't plop a tablespoon either just a tiny bit. I think the flavor varies from person to person though. I like it salted preferred to unsalted though ^-^,Brenna Michelle Bucklin,2017-08-01T18:45:53.000Z,0

https://www.facebook.com/tadkatales/posts/1760955867535264,Rhoda Hudiburgh I honestly couldn't tell you because I'm not a dietian or very knowledgeable on the subject. this is just personally how I enjoy the coffee and see my own results (: you most likely could just use heavy whipping cream. I think that the point of the butter is just to add more fat if you're on a keto diet !,Brenna Michelle Bucklin,2017-08-01T19:03:39.000Z,2
https://www.facebook.com/tadkatales/posts/1760955867535264,but that's a really good question! I know you have to wash casein off butter when you make it from scratch so maybe it has to do with the amount that's in the whipping cream? casein is a protein though so I don't  think it is something people who are trying to work out want to skip on. especially because you can buy powdered casein for protein drinks!,Brenna Michelle Bucklin,2017-08-01T19:06:23.000Z,1

I really like this blog because it explains a lot of the things I have only a little knowledge on. 

the recipe: 
2 cups coffee
2 tbsp butter
2 tbsp coconut oil

you put the ingredients in a nutribullet or some sort of blender and blend it together for about 2 minutes (:",Brenna Michelle Bucklin,2017-08-01T19:25:56.000Z,0

https://www.facebook.com/tadkatales/posts/1760955867535264,butter from scratch isn't supposed to be sweet unless you're trying to sweeten it. When youre making butter from heavy cream you're separating the casein from the cream (from what I understood which is why you wash the butter so it doesn't go rancid) so all that's left is the fat and not any protein. you can sweeten it with sugar but I usually just add salt.
